                A rainy day is the bearer of good weather with refrigerating breeze and rain showers.
                It refreshes everyone by making the climate cool and delightsome and brings in a sigh 
                of relief from the scorching heat. Rainy day gives us relief from the usually hot and 
                humid climate.
