			The extended Euclidean algorithm is particularly useful when a and 			
			b are coprime. With that provision, x is the modular 			
			multiplicative inverse of a modulo b, and y is the modular 			
			multiplicative inverse of b modulo a. Similarly, the polynomial 			
			extended Euclidean algorithm allows one to compute the 			
			multiplicative inverse in algebraic field extensions and, in 			
			particular in finite fields of non prime order. It follows that 			
			both extended Euclidean algorithms are widely used in.

			To implement the algorithm that is described above, one should 			
			first remark that only the two last values of the indexed 			
			variables are needed at each step. Thus, for saving memory, each 			
			indexed variable must be replaced by just two variables.
