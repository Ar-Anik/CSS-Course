                A rainy day is the bearer of good weather with refrigerating breeze and rain showers. 
                It refreshes everyone by making the climate cool and delightsome and brings in a sigh
                of relief from the scorching heat.

                Rainy day gives us relief from the usually hot and humid climate.
                Rainy day is portrayed by a cool whisk, drizzle and the sweet smell
                of soil. The trees and vegetation around us get washed by rain and 
                reveals its lush green colour. The full view becomes enchanting with 
                dark clouds all over the sky with periodic lightening.
