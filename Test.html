			Rainy day comes as a musical surprise for all, bringing a luscious climate and chilling weather.
			Dark clouds shower water droplets over the earth underneath them. The climate becomes pleasant â€“ not too cold, neither too hot on a rainy day.
			A rainy day cleans the flora on land and makes everything look new and fresh; as a result, 
			the greenery around us reveals its lush green colour. A rainy day is also suitable for irrigation and increasing the yield, 
			and also for opening up the prospects of conserving rainwater for the future, for it helps to refill the natural water bodies of earth.
