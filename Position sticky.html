            Child labour is generated in our country as an
            offshoot to the vicious cycle of poverty.

            The cycle begins with a low level of investment. 
            The per capita income in a developing country like India is low. 
            This means that most of the people do not get enough food to survive
            on for the first few years of living. This gives them lower nutrition 
            levels, and the quality of child labour is hence severely low in our 
            country. It is below average, and making good with such below-average 
            labour in a labour surplus economy is tedious. This again increased the 
            need for money in e lowest if the society and they put in their children 
            into the harsh world to earn a living for themselves. These children are 
            often subjected to tremendous brutality and abuse at the hands of those 
            that employ them. They are kept under inhuman circumstances and work massive 
            shifts.Child Labour is the broad term under which we can fit the attempt to rob a child of their
            childhood. It snatches from the child their untapped potential and only harnesses very little of the 
            energy that the child possesses. It is harmful to the child and stunts their mental as well as physical 
            development. It surely scars the child for life. It is an immoral practice and tampers with the development 
            process of the child. The child is left scarred for life. The amount of emotional pressure it puts on them 
            is unimaginable. The other children who work in the same facility are also subjected to tremendous violence
            and are kept in unfavorable conditions. Since they grow up looking at these atrocities, they become harmful
            adults too.A large section of these child labourers is found to be of unsound mind when they grow up.Some
            of them may even turn out to be criminals. So the impact of living in such conditions is massive. 
            The repercussions of being in such an environment are traumatizing, to say the least. It interferes 
            with the proper education procedure that these children deserve to get. Their schooling is often 
            stopped midway. Pushed into the harsh world, the child finds it difficult to cope—the forms of 
            child labour include any form of slavery-like bonded labour and the likes of it.Child sexual abuse
             also stems from such claustrophobic situations. These child labourers are often made to beg 
             on the streets. They are trained for this in such a way that no one would be able to understand 
             that they aren’t actually beggars. These children are out in harsh conditions and often have to
              work inhuman hours. They aren’t given proper food, and the payment is minimal too. Child 
              labour has been banned in several countries. The Indian Government has time and again 
              tried to curb the extent of child labour but all to vain. This happens mostly due to the 
              problems that the household faces.
