			This 2015 psychological thriller follows a young programmer who is selected to be the human component 
			in a Turing test to determine the capabilities and consciousness of a new artificial intelligence robot. 
			AI isnâ€™t a new concept in cinema, but this recent Oscar-nominated movie has solidified itself as one of 
			the best. It essentially warns of the not-so-distant day when robots become indistinguishable from us and 
			the ethical implications that arise from that. Ex Machina questions how far innovation should be pursued 
			and the morality of playing God. As corporations rush to develop better AI in real life, these are all 
			issues that need to be given thought before the tech is unleashed on our world.
