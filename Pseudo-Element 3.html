                A rainy day is the bearer of good weather with refrigerating breeze and rain showers. 
                It refreshes everyone by making the climate cool and delightsome and brings in a sigh 
                of relief from the scorching heat.Rainy day gives us relief from the usually hot and 
                humid climate. Rainy day is portrayed by a cool whisk, drizzle and the sweet smell of
                soil. The trees and vegetation around us get washed by rain and reveals its lush green 
                colour. The full view becomes enchanting with dark clouds all over the sky with periodic 
                lightening.Water becomes abundance, and every pool or depression gets filled in the rainy
                season. Rain brings various reptilian and amphibian species out of their hiding like 
                snakes and frogs. Sometimes during heavy rain, schools declare a holiday Rainy day is the 
                day when nature reveals all its hidden surprises to us.
