                A rainy day is the bearer of good weather with refrigerating breeze and rain showers. 
                It refreshes everyone by making the climate cool and delightsome and brings in a sigh
                of relief from the scorching heat.Rainy day gives us relief from the usually hot and 
                humid climate. Rainy day is portrayed by a cool whisk, drizzle and the sweet smell of 
                soil. The trees and vegetation around us get washed by rain and reveals its lush green 
                colour. The full view becomes enchanting with dark clouds all over the sky with periodic 
                lightening.
