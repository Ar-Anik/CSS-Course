			Putting this Marvel superhero movie on the list might surprise some, but it’s hard to understate just
			how tech-savvy it is. Eccentric playboy billionaire Tony Stark develops the impressively high-tech Iron
			Man suit to escape captivity, and then returns home to save the world with it. Beyond the suit, the 
			gesture-based computer system, helpful sentient robots, and cool gadgets make this one of the best 
			celebrations of tech culture on the big screen. It’s also a good reminder of the dangers it poses when 
			turned into weapons in the wrong hands. The more recent Black Panther and Avengers movies, or even the 
			Dark Knight series, also fall under this category, but Iron Man was the original superhero movie built 
			around innovation.
